# Website Project

This project involves creating a simple website using HTML5, which includes a homepage and at least three additional pages: **Home**, **About**, **Services**, and **Contact**. Each page follows the basic HTML5 structure and contains various elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and forms.

## General Structure

The website is built using the **HTML5** document structure, with the following features:

- **`<head>`** includes the page title and character set (`<meta charset="UTF-8">`).
- **`<body>`** contains the main content of the page, organized into sections.

### Pages:
1. **Home Page (index.html)**: 
   - Main header with a title (`<h1>`), describing the purpose of the website.
   - Several paragraphs (`<p>`) that provide introductory text.
   - At least one image (`<img>`) with an alt attribute describing the content of the image.
   - A list of important points or services, either ordered (`<ol>`) or unordered (`<ul>`).
  
2. **About Page (about.html)**:
   - A header (`<h2>`) and several paragraphs providing information about the company or individual.
   - An ordered list (`<ol>`) describing important dates or events, such as founding dates or milestones.

3. **Services Page (services.html)**:
   - A list of services offered, each with a heading (`<h2>`) and a descriptive paragraph (`<p>`).
   - The services are listed using an unordered list (`<ul>`).

4. **Contact Page (contact.html)**:
   - A header (`<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`) providing contact information.
   - Contact details (address, phone number, email) are listed using an unordered list (`<ul>`).
   - A contact form (`<form>`) is included with fields for name, email, and message. (Note: No back-end processing is required for this form, as it only collects user input.)

## Navigation Menu

Each page contains a navigation menu at the top, linking to other pages on the website. The menu should have at least four links (`<a>` tags): 

- **Home**
- **About**
- **Services**
- **Contact**
